## Further Development

As I develop this project, I would like to adjust the styling so that it looks more unique, eye-catching, etc. 
I want it to have "tea" from both a visual standpoint and a functionality standpoint.
	** By having "tea", I'm refering to the Eastern Civilization concept of beauty/artfullness, pleasurableness of use, etc.
	I.E. One reason Apple products became popular because they have a certain kind of "tea". Simplicity, ease of use to the user, zen stlying, etc.**

As I develop this project, I would like t0 structure the webpage so that what is currently the benefits section becomes a window within a window where the user can scroll through my various projects.  

As I develop this project, I would like to add a message section, where the user can type me a message in a field, hit send, and that message gets sent to my email inbox; this will improve to the user experience by allowing them to reach out to me without copying my email address, navigating to their email, pasting my address, THEN typing a message, etc.
