## Description

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

- The motivation for this project is the need to display my skills and work value to potential employers.

- The project was built to market myself and my skills to potential employers, as well as networking within the developer community in general.  

- It solves problem of being unable to connect with employers and other developers unless I leave my house.

- During this project, I learned many new things, including:
    -How to create github repositories and initialize them with my local machine.
    --Learned about putting the theories of git/github into practice.  
	Creating and initializing repositories,staging commits, pushing to repository,
	etc, to have functional version control.

	-Learned about semantic HTML elements, structuring the file logically. etc.

	-Played around with making changes to the HTML file to adjust the structure
	of the webpage, and the CSS file to adjust the style of the webpage.

	-Assessed the purpose of the webpage, made bonus changes to stlying sheets to
	draw more attention to the name of the company, and how it ties in with their
	products and services. (Adjusted color of "SEO" in the main header to be darker
	and bring out the contrast, drawing more attention to the acronym.
	The original wasn't different enough to easily draw the users attention to that
	feature of the website.
